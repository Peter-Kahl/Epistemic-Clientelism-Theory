### Abstract

This paper introduces Epistemic Clientelism Theory (ECT), my original theoretical framework designed explicitly to analyse the systemic delegation of epistemic agency within academic institutions through entrenched political power dynamics. I argue that academic hierarchies institutionalise epistemic clientelism—a strategic yet coerced exchange in which scholars surrender epistemic autonomy to institutional authorities in return for professional recognition, material resources, and symbolic rewards. Building rigorously upon my foundational scholarship, particularly ‘Epistemic Justice and Institutional Responsibility in Academia’ (2025) and “Directors’ Epistemic Duties and Fiduciary Openness” (2025), I synthesise fiduciary theory, democratic epistemology, Joseph Raz’s service conception of legitimate authority, Michel Foucault’s critique of disciplinary power/knowledge structures, Martin Heidegger’s authenticity versus institutional alienation, psychological theories of conformity (Milgram, Zimbardo), systems theory, political clientelism literature (Scott, Stokes), and script theory (Schank and Abelson). The analysis explicitly demonstrates how epistemic clientelism constitutes profound fiduciary breaches within academia, systematically marginalises alternative epistemological frameworks, undermines scholarly authenticity, and erodes democratic epistemological practices. To address these entrenched institutional failures, I conclude with assertive fiduciary-epistemic governance reforms explicitly designed to dismantle epistemic clientelism, restore epistemic autonomy, revitalise inclusive and participatory knowledge production, and reassert academia’s fiduciary accountability to truth, fairness, and democratic epistemic ideals.

### Acknowledgements

This paper is part of a wider research programme on fiduciary-epistemic governance, and will be integrated into my forthcoming monograph _Beyond Epistemic Clientelism_. I am grateful to colleagues, interlocutors, and readers across philosophy, law, and higher education who have challenged and refined these ideas.
