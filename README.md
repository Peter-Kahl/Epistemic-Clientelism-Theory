### Abstract

This essay critically examines Andrew Knight’s celebratory blog post on the UK Civil Service’s policy design pavilion at the London Design Biennale, exposing underlying issues of epistemic gatekeeping, performative openness, and insufficient fiduciary accountability. While Knight frames the event as a demonstration of democratic participation and transparency through public engagement, closer analysis reveals superficial inclusivity and curated epistemic control. Drawing from my recent scholarship—specifically ‘Epistemic Gatekeepers and Epistemic Injustice by Design’ (2025) and ‘Directors’ Epistemic Duties and Fiduciary Openness’ (2025)—I argue that without transparent epistemic criteria, clear accountability mechanisms, and authentic democratic co-creation, such policy initiatives risk becoming mere spectacles rather than meaningful democratic exercises. To address these shortcomings, the essay proposes explicit solutions, including epistemic transparency, structured accountability frameworks, critical reflexivity, and genuine epistemic pluralism, offering a blueprint for achieving authentic democratic legitimacy in government policy design.
